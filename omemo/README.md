# OMEMO Plugin for Gajim

This is an experimental plugin that adds support for the [OMEMO
Encryption](http://conversations.im/omemo) to [Gajim](https://gajim.org/). This
plugin is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3 or any later version.

**DO NOT rely on this plugin to protect sensitive information!** 

## Installation
You can install this plugin via the Gajim PluginManager or by cloning the git repository into Gajim's plugin directory.

```shell
mkdir ~/.local/share/gajim/plugins -p
cd ~/.local/share/gajim/plugins
git clone https://github.com/kalkin/gajim-omemo
```

### Dependencies
#### Gajim
You need Gajim version 0.16.4. If your package manager does not provide an up to date 
version you can install it from the official Mercurial repository. 
```shell
hg clone https://hg.gajim.org/gajim
cd gajim
hg update gajim-0.16.4 --clean
```

#### Python libraries
You *have* to install `python-axolotl` via `pip`. Depending on your setup you might
want to use `pip2` as Gajim is using python2.7. If you are using the official repository,
do not forget to install the `nxmpp` dependency via pip or you package manager.

## Running
Enable *OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption* in the Plugin-Manager.
Before exchanging encrypted messages with a contact you have to hit the *Get
Device Keys* button. (Repeat that if you or your contact get new devices.)

Currently the plugin has no user interface for confirming the own and foreign
device keys.  It uses trust on first use. This will be added in near future.

## Debugging
To see OMEMO related debug output start Gajim with the parameter `-l
gajim.plugin_system.omemo=DEBUG`.
