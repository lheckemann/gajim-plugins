- Query own Device Bundles on send button press
- Make Fingerprint Window higher and rename Buttons for something more appropriate
- Bugfixes


0.8.0 / 2016-08-03
- Encryption improvements:
-- SignedPreKey renews every 24 hours
-- New PreKeys are generated and published if less then 80 are available
-- If the Python Cryptography package is installed native encryption is now used (faster on old devices)
-- Bundle Information is only pulled right before sending a Message (see Business rules of the OMEMO XEP)
-- If Contact supports OMEMO, encryption is activated automatically 

- Other Stuff:
-- The Fingerprint Window pops up if the Send Button is pressed and there are new Fingerprints in the DB
-- Message Correction now works with OMEMO (Press STRG + UP Arrow to correct the last send message)
-- SQL Refactoring, so new users dont have to go through DB Migration
-- Small bugfixes
